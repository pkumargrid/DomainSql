# SQL Queries for HealthCare System

## Task
### You can find the queries below in the sql file
```
Practice in writing SQL queries for your domain. Create a script with SQL requests that cover your domain business logic. It should include:

1. At least one full CRUD set of queries for your domain entity [shown for patient table]
2. Search query with dynamic filters, pagination and sorting [shown for patient table]
3. Search query with joined data for your use-cases (for example when we fetching a Book for our library main page, we need to see whole Author name, so it should be joined)
[shown using patient and nurse]
4. Statistic query; can be not related to your use-cases (for example return authors and number of books they wrote)
[shown for each nurse how many patients she is dealing with]
5. Top-something query (for example return authors and number of books they wrote ordered by books count)
[we have just ordered the count of patients each nurse handling by the count itself]
```
